# The Ford Engine

## What is the principle of the gasoline-driven Engine?

Gasoline when mixed with air and compressed is highly explosive. An explosion is a violent expansion caused by instantaneous combustion of confined gases. In the gasoline engine the mixture is drawn into a cylinder, where it is compressed by an advancing piston and then exploded by an electric spark, which sends the piston downward, and through the connecting rod imparts a rotary motion to the crankshaft.

## What are functions of the Pistons?

On the downward stroke the suction of the piston draws the fresh gas from the carburetor, through the inlet pipe and valve, into the cylinder. The upward movement of the piston compresses the gas into a very small space, between the top of the piston and the depression in the cylinder head, known as the "combustion chamber." (The compressed gases exert a pressure of approximately 60 pounds per square inch.) At this point the electric spark explodes the gases---driving the piston downward---thus producing the power which turns the crankshaft. On the next stroke upward the piston drives the exploded gas out through the exhaust valve and pipe to the muffler. (See Cut No. 2.)

## Connecting Rod---how removed?

It is a steel rod, connecting piston and crank shaft. Should the babbitt bearing become worn, or burned out through lack of oil, a knocking in the engine will result---in which case the entire connecting rod should be replaced. To make this replacement, (1) drain oil from crank case; (2) take off cylinder head; (3) remove detachable plate on bottom of crank case; (4) disconnect connecting rod from crank shaft; (S) take piston and rod out through top of cylinder.
When replacing a rod on which babbitt has burned out, make sure the crankshaft is free from any babbitt left by the burned out rod. This babbitt can be removed by means of a piece of oiled sandpaper.

## What is the Valve Arrangement?

One intake and one exhaust valve are located in each cylinder. The former admits the fresh gas drawn from the carburetor through the inlet pipe---the latter permits the exploded gas to be driven out through the exhaust pipe. The valves are alternately opened and closed (see Cut No. 2) by the cams on the cam shaft striking against push rods which in turn lift the valves from their seats.

## What about Valve timing?

In timing the engine the points of opening and closing of the valves are, of course, what should be considered. As the valves are properly timed at the factory when the engine is built the necessity for retiming would occur only when such parts as the cam shaft, time gears or valves were removed in overhauling the engine.
The time gears must mesh so that the tooth marked "Ford" on the small time gear will come between the two teeth on the large gear at the point marked zero (0). The time gears now being properly set, the exhaust valve on No. 1 cylinder is open and the intake valve closed, the other valves being in the position indicated in Cut No. 2. The opening and closing of the valves being as follows: The exhaust valve opens when the piston reaches 5/16" of bottom center, the distance from the top of the piston head to the top of cylinder casting measuring 3-3/8". The exhaust valve will close on top center, the piston being 5/16" above the cylinder casting. The intake valve opens 1/16" after top center, and closes 9/16" after bottom center, the distance from the top of the piston to the top of the cylinder casting measuring 3- 1/8".

## What about the care of the Valves?

They seldom get out of order---but they do get dirty, as a result of carbon collecting on the valve seats. These carbon deposits, by preventing proper closing of the valves, permit the gases under compression to escape, resulting in loss of power and uneven running of the motor. If, when turning the engine over slowly, there is a lack of resistance in one or more cylinders, it is probable that the valves need re- grinding. As the "life" of the engine depends largely upon the proper seating of the valves, it is necessary that they be ground occasionally.

## How are Valves removed for grinding?

(1) Drain radiator; (2) remove cylinder head; (3) remove the valve cover on the right side of engine; (4) raise the valve spring with lifting tool (see Cut No.3) and pull out the valve seat pin that is in the valve stem. The valve may then be lifted out by the head.

## How are Valves ground?

For this work use a good valve grinding compound. A convenient way is to put a small amount in a suitable dish, adding a spoonful or two of kerosene and a few drops of lubricating oil to make a thin paste.

Place the mixture sparingly on the bevel face of the valve. Put the valve in position on the valve seat, and rotate it back and forth (about a quarter turn) a few times, with a Ford grinding tool. Then lift slightly from the seat, change the position and continue the rotation, and keep on repeating this operation until the bearing surface is smooth and bright. The valve should not be turned through a complete revolution, as this is apt to cause scratches running around the entire circumference of the valve and seat.

The valve should not be turned through a complete revolution, as this is apt to cause scratches running around the entire circumference of the valve and seat.

When the grinding is completed the valve should be removed from the cylinder, thoroughly washed with kerosene, and the valve seat wiped out thoroughly. Extreme care should be taken that no abrasive substance gets into the cylinders or valve guides. This can be avoided if the grinding paste is applied sparingly to the bevel face of the valve.

If the valve seat is badly worn or pitted, it is best to have it reseated with a valve seating tool. This operation requires considerable skill, and perhaps had better be done by an expert mechanic. Care should be exercised against making too deep a cut, necessitating the retiming of the valve.

## When the Valves and Push Rods are worn---what?

When the valves or push rods become worn, so as to leave too much play between them, thus reducing the lift of the valves and diminishing the power of the motor, it is best to install new push rods. If replacing the push rod does not give the desired clearance, the valve should also be replaced. Installation of new push rods or valves necessitates retiming the motor (See Answer No. 22.)

## What about the Valve Springs?

When the valves fail to seat themselves properly, there is a possibility that the springs may be weak or broken. Weakness in the exhaust valve spring causes a very uneven action. the symptoms are a lag in the engine due to the exhaust valve not closing instantaneously, and as a result a certain percentage of the charge under compression escapes, greatly diminishing the force of the explosion. Weakness in a valve spring can usually be detected by the following method: Remove the plate which encloses them at the side of the cylinder and insert a screw-driver between the coils of the spring while the engine is running. If the extra tension thus produced causes the engine to pick up speed, the spring is obviously weak and should be replaced with a new one

## What causes "Knocking" in the Engine?

There are several causes, which may be enumerated as follows: (1) carbon knock which is by far the most common---resulting from carbonizing of cylinders; (2) knock caused by a too advanced spark; (3) connecting rod knock; (4) crank shaft main bearing knock; (5) knock due to loose-fitting piston or broken ring; (6) knock caused by the piston striking the cylinder head gasket. When the engine knocks from any cause whatsoever, the matter should be promptly investigated by an experienced mechanic and the difficulty corrected.

## How may the different Knocks be distinguished?

(1) The carbon knock is a clear, hollow sound, most noticeable in climbing sharp grades, particularly when the engine is heated. It is also indicated by a sharp rap immediately on advancing the throttle. (2) Too advanced spark will be indicated by a dull knock in the motor. (3) The connecting rod knock sounds like the distant tapping of steel with a small hammer, and is readily distinguished when the car is allowed to run idly down grade---or upon speeding the car to twenty-five miles an hour, then suddenly closing the throttle, the tapping will be very distinct. (4) The crank shaft main bearing knock can be distinguished, when the car is going uphill, as a dull thud. (5) The loose piston knock is heard only upon suddenly opening the throttle, when the sound produced might be likened to a rattle. The remedies for these knocks are treated under their proper division.

## How is carbon removed from Combustion Chamber?

First, drain the water off by opening the pet cock at the bottom of the radiator; then disconnect the wires at the top of the motor and remove the spark coil; also disconnect the cylinder head outlet connection. Remove the 15 cap screws which hold the cylinder head in place. Take off the cylinder head and, with a putty knife or carbon scraper, scrape the carbonized matter from the cylinder head and top of pistons, being careful to prevent the specks of carbon from getting into the cylinders or bolt holes. In replacing the cylinder head gasket turn the motor over so that No. 1 and No. 4 pistons are at top center; place the gasket in position over the pistons and then put the cylinder head in place. Be sure and draw the cylinder head bolts down evenly (i.e., give each bolt a few turns at a time); do not tighten them on one end before drawing them up at the other. After the engine has warmed up the bolts should again be tightened.

## How are Spark Plugs cleaned?

After removing the plug from the engine the points may be cleaned with an old tooth brush dipped in gasoline. However, in order to do the work thoroughly, the plug should be taken apart by securing the large hexagon steel shell in a vise and loosening the pack nut which holds the porcelain in place. The carbon deposits can then be easily removed from the porcelain and shell with a small knife. Care should be exercised not to scrape off the glazed surface of the porcelain, otherwise it will be apt to carbonize quickly. The porcelain and other parts should finally be washed in gasoline and wiped dry with a cloth. In assembling the plug care should be taken to see that the pack nut is not tightened too much so as to crack the porcelain, and the distance between the sparking points should be 1/32", about the thickness of a smooth dime.

## How is the Power Plant removed from the Car?

(1) Drain the radiator; disconnect inlet and outlet water connections; disconnect radiator stay rod at dash; remove stud nuts fastening radiator to frame, and remove radiator starting crank and radiator apron.
(2) Shut off gasoline at sediment bulb; disconnect feed pipe at carburetor; remove carburetor adjusting rods, priming rods and pull rod.
(3) Disconnect steering gear arm and bracket; disconnect steering gear post at dash and instrument board; disconnect commutator pull rod and horn wires and move steering gear back.
(4) Disconnect radius rod from crank case.
(5) Disconnect all wires and remove coil box and spark plugs.
(6) Remove engine pans and hood blocks.
(7) Disconnect exhaust pipe from manifold.
(8) Remove four bolts at universal joint housing, two bolts from each crank case arm and two cap screws at crank case front bearing.
(9) Pass a rope around the engine, placing the rope behind the two radius rod studs and between starting motor and cylinder block, tying the ends of the rope securely at top of engine. Pass a 2" x 4" or a stout iron pipe about ten feet long through the loop in the rope, and with a man at each end of the 2" x 4" or pipe and another holding the starting crank handle, the engine can be lifted from the car.

## Connecting Rod Bearings---how adjusted

Connecting rod bearings may be adjusted, without taking out the engine, by the following method: (1) drain off the oil; (2) remove plate on bottom of crank case--- exposing connecting rods; (3) take off first connecting rod cap, and draw---file the ends---a very little at a time; (4) replace cap, being careful to see that file marks correspond, and tighten bolts until cap fits shaft snugly; (5) test tightness of bearing by turning engine over by the starting handle. Experienced mechanics usually determine when the bearing is properly fitted by lightly tapping each side of the cap with a hammer; (6) then loosen the bearing and proceed to fit the other bearings in the same manner; (7) after each bearing has been properly fitted and tested---then tighten the cap bolts and insert cotter pins and the work is finished.

Remember, there is a possibility of getting the bearings too tight, and under such conditions the babbitt is apt to cut out quickly, unless precaution is taken to run the motor slowly at the start. It is a good plan after adjusting the bearings to jack up the rear wheels and let the motor run slowly for about two hours (keeping it well supplied with water and oil) before taking it out on the road. Whenever possible these bearings should be fitted by an expert Ford mechanic.

Worn connecting rods may be returned, prepaid, to the nearest dealer for exchange at a price of $0.60 each to cover the cost of rebabbitting. It is not advisable for any owner or repair shop to attempt the rebabbitting of connecting rods or main bearings, for without a special jig in which to form the bearings, satisfactory results will not be obtained. The constant tapping of a loose connecting rod on the crank shaft will eventually produce crystallization of the steel---result, broken crank shaft and possibly other parts of the engine damaged.

## Crank Shaft Main Bearings---How adjusted?

Should the main bearings in which the crank shaft revolves become worn (evidenced by a pounding in the engine) and need adjusting, proceed as follows:
(1) Remove carburetor pull rod, cylinder valve cover and crank case lower cover.
(2) To remove the rear main bearing cap, it is necessary to break the fly wheel cap screw wire and remove one of the fly wheel cap screws.
(3) Remove rear bearing cap and one brass shim from each bolt.
(4) Clean out any babbitt from oil grooves in bearing cap and cover surface of bearing with oil.
(5) Replace cap, making sure it is installed in its original position.
(6) Run down the two crankshaft bearing bolt nuts drawing them down tightly and lining up nut with cotter pin hole, so that cotter pin can be entered. In locating the cotter pin bole, never turn the nut back. If the cotter pin hole in the bolt does not line up with the nut, run the nut back sufficiently far to insure a new setting, then draw nut down tightly, taking care not to pass cotter pin hole.
(7) Test for tightness of bearing by turning engine over slowly with starting crank (a slight increase in resistance should be noted).
(8) If bearing cap is still loose, remove another shim from each of the two bolts. If adjustment is too tight, replace the shim on one of the bolts, then run down the nuts and lock them with cotter keys.
(9) Replace flywheel cap screw, and fasten with lock wire.
(10) The center bearing is adjusted next, and the front bearing is adjusted last. These two bearings are adjusted in the same manner as the rear main bearing.
(11) Replace crank case lower cover, cylinder valve cover and carburetor pull rod. Note---If with all shims removed, it is impossible to properly fit the bearing, the cap may be filed off, but in all probability the babbitt in the cylinder block has been worn to such an extent that the block should be rebabbitted.

## How are leaks and jams in the Radiator repaired?

While the stopping of one tube does not seriously interfere with the circulation, it is bound to cause trouble sooner or later---and the tube will freeze in cold weather. Cut the tube an inch above and below the jam and insert a new piece, soldering the connections. If the entire radiator is badly jammed or broken it would probably be advisable to install a new one.
